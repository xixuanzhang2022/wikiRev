A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing content patterns, community interactions, network structure, and diffusion dynamics in social media â€”developed in Python.
The code in this repository was originally developed to support the data collection and analyses presented in the paper: **Zhang, X. (2023). Diffusion Dynamics and Digital Movement: the Emergence and Proliferation of the German-speaking #FridaysForFuture Network on Twitter. *Social Movement Studies*. [https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448251336418](https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2023.2211015)**


**Data Preparation & Loading**

load_data.py: Handles importing and initial preprocessing of raw Twitter or cascade datasets.

**Cascade Modeling & Metrics**

cascade_builder.py: Constructs cascade structures from social interaction logs.

cascade_network_metric.py: Computes network-level metrics for diffusion cascades.

cascade_analysis.py: Performs in-depth analysis of cascade behavior.

centrality_sliding.py: Tracks changes in centrality over time using sliding windows.

time_series_analysis.py: Analyzes temporal dynamics within cascades.

**Embedding & Clustering**

embedding_clustering.py: Applies embeddings (e.g., user or content-level) and clustering techniques for cascade segmentation.

**Topic & Content Analysis**

topic_model.py: Extracts thematic patterns from cascade content via topic modeling.

**Pipeline Entry Point**

main.py: Orchestrates overall analysis, allowing streamlined execution of loading, modeling, and analysis workflows.
